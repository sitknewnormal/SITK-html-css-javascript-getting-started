## Building Websites With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Docker: Getting Started

Depending on what type of software product you are developing, the technologies involved. Even the architecture you are going to choose to perform this task, you will need to install and set up a bunch of different stuff in your machine and spend lots of hours, sleepless nights and sweat to come up with the “state of the art” software as the final result.

It’s also common sense that every software product has its lifecycle, and it’s your responsibility to guarantee its evolution along with all the libraries, frameworks and many other pieces of software you tirelessly used to build it! It’s not fair that with all effort you have put into building software with all the invaluable skills, you still have to deal with some inevitable environmental issues caused by too much stuff cluttered on your computer!

You might have caught yourself in this somewhat horrible situation during the application development at least once in your life as a developer, haven’t you?!

Hopefully, there is a solution to this, and the answer is Docker container!

### Tools
The following tools are good suggestions to make it easier to work with coding.

* git: A tool for managing source code
* Visual Studio Code: A source code editor
* Live Server: A simple web server utility for Visual Studio Code


### Setup
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine like this.

```
git clone https://github.com/sitknewnormal/SITK-html-css-js-getting-started
```
* Once the files are on your machine, open the *SITK-html-css-js-getting-started* folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the Go Live button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
